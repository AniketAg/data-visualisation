Data Visualisation

To begin with this I first converted the two given xlsx files to the csv files and then implemented the following visualisations.

1.	Nightingale’s Dataset: 
The following visualisation was made in Processing 3.5.3, the desktop version that uses Java as the programming language. A coxcomb chart is used for representing the data, and the arcs are drawn which form a ‘pie’. Layers with different colours represent the possible death types.  

2.	Minard’s Map: 
The following visualisation was also made in Processing 3.5.3, which depicts the Napoleon’s Russian campaign. Each division has a different colour which depends on whether they are attacking or retreating. A label box depicts what each colour represents. The alpha and the stroke values change depending upon the number of survivors. The map also shows the temperature at various locations.

After creating both the visualisations I save them in the jpeg format using the saveFrame() function and then I converted that to the pdf version. And then combined the 2 pdfs and the word document to one pdf.
